# Montague-like type-theoretical grammar

* `MontagueTT` — Simple grammar.  It doesn't allow syntactically correct
  but semantically wrong sentences.
* `MontagueTTcoercion` — A grammar with common nouns (postulated) coercion.
* `MontagueTTfeatures` — Common nouns are types defined through features.
  This presentation allows to define coercion.
* `MontagueTT2` — Two levels of syntax.  This makes syntactically correct
  but semantically wrong sentences possible.
